# RAG-Based AI Research Assistant

> Efficiently Discover, Analyze, and Summarize Research Papers Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Modern NLP Techniques.

---

## Introduction

The exponential growth of academic papers makes it increasingly challenging for researchers to stay updated. We aims to alleviate this burden by automating:

- **Fetching relevant papers from arXiv**
- **Summarizing and comparing papers via a RAG-powered chat assistant**
- **Visualizing relationships between papers through TF-IDF similarity matrices**

By leveraging cutting-edge AI and information retrieval techniques, DEEPLOST helps streamline literature reviews and research exploration.

## Features

- **Topic-Based Paper Fetching**: Retrieve papers from arXiv with simple keyword queries.
- **Interactive Chat**: Summarize, compare, and query papers using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
- **Similarity Visualization**: Generate and view a TF-IDF-based heatmap of paper similarities.
- **Customizable & Open**: Modify embedding models, prompts, or expand sources easily.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Powered by Gradio; no complex setup required.
